# iPoduino Notes Converter
A simple serverless web-based tool made with vanilla JS/HTML/CSS to convert songs into Arduino code for the IEEE iPoduino project.
Created with CodeSandbox

All songs must come from [this website](https://pianoletternotes.blogspot.com/p/modern.html) or must be formatted in the same way as they are on this website. There are thousands of songs on here so you'll be able to find yours! See song.txt for an example on formatting.

# How to use
1. Copy notes from any song on [this website](https://pianoletternotes.blogspot.com/p/modern.html) and store it as a .txt file
2. Upload the .txt file to the website and it'll automatically convert it
3. Click "copy to clipboard" to export it to your Arduino

# To-do
- Optimizing code output to take less space
- Output value as array rather than function calls
